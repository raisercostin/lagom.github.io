        <p>
            Bug reports help Lagom improve, so please report any issues you have!
            Lagom uses <a href="//github.com/lagom/lagom/issues">GitHub to track issues</a>.
            When you report bugs, make sure you include lots of detail, including reproducible tests, example code or anything else you think might help.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even if you're not ready to fix issues yourself just yet, you can help out by verifying issues that have been reported by others.
            Look for issues tagged with the <a href="//github.com/lagom/lagom/issues?labels=needs-verification">needs-verification</a> label.
            You can assist by looking at these issues and doing some checking to confirm whether they're bugs or not.
            You could provide reproducible tests or a sample project, or even just ask the original reporter for more information.
        </p>
