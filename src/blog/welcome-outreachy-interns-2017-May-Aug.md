    Congratulations to Lagom's Outreachy Interns Ruchika Lakhina and Yuliana Apaza!
---

Lightbend and Lagom are proud to be participating in [Outreachy](https://gnome.org/outreachy/), a program to help groups that are underrepresented in free and open source software get involved.

We're happy to announce that [Ruchika Lakhina](https://github.com/lakhina) and [Yuliana Apaza](https://yuliana.me/) have been accepted to work on Lagom for the May - August 2017 round of Outreachy

We had several fantastic applicants, and the entire Lagom team has been very impressed with the quality of contributions to Lagom from Outreachy applicants. In the end, Ruchika and Yuliana stood out as active contributors who collaborated well with Lagom developers and each other, and both prepared thoughtful and detailed proposals for how they plan to spend their time during the Outreachy internship.

They will both be working on improvements to our Online Auction example application ([Java version](https://github.com/lagom/online-auction-java)/[Scala version](https://github.com/lagom/online-auction-scala)). Online Auction demonstrates a broad range of Lagom's features and architectural practices. Ruchika and Yuliana will be continuing development of this example by rounding out the functionality and including examples of more Lagom features.

Please join me in welcoming them to the project!
