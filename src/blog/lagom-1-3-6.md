## Updating a Lagom project to version 1.3.6

To update an sbt project, change the version of `lagom-sbt-plugin` in your `project/plugins.sbt` file.

To update a Maven project, change the `lagom.version` property in your top-level `pom.xml`.

After updating, it is recommended to fix any new deprecation warnings you see when compiling or running your services.
