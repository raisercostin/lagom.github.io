The Lagom team has just released Lagom 1.3.1, with a few small, but important, bug fixes.

For those who have not made the jump to Lagom 1.3 yet, we also released 1.2.3 with backported bug fixes for issues that affect the 1.2 series.

To update an sbt project, change the version of `lagom-sbt-plugin` in your `project/plugins.sbt` file.

To update a Maven project, change the `lagom.version` property in your top-level `pom.xml`.

See the [change log](/changelog.html) for more details on exactly what has been fixed in each release.
